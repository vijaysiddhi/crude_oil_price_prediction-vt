# crude_oil_price_prediction-vt
# Overview
This project focuses on predicting crude oil prices using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict future prices based on historical data and relevant features.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is 'crude-oil-prices.csv', which contains historical crude oil prices. The dataset includes features such as Date, Closing Price, Open Price, High Price, Low Price, and Volume.

# Steps

# 1)Data Preprocessing: 
The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, convert date columns, and scale the data if necessary.
# 2)Feature Engineering: 
Additional features may be created from the existing ones to improve the model's performance.
# 3)Exploratory Data Analysis: 
Analyze the dataset to understand the relationships between features and the target variable.
# 4)Model Selection: 
Select a machine learning model suitable for the task, such as linear regression, decision tree, or random forest.
# 5)Model Training: 
Train the selected model on the preprocessed dataset.
# 6)Model Evaluation: 
Evaluate the trained model using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error or R-squared.
# 7)Prediction: 
Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
# 8)Visualization:
Visualize the predicted prices against the actual prices to assess the model's performance.

# Requirements:
1)Python 3
2)Pandas
3)NumPy
4)Matplotlib
5)Scikit-learn

# Usage

# 1)Install the required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train the model and make predictions.
