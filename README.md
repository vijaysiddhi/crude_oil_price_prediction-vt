# crude_oil_price_prediction-vt
# Overview
This project focuses on predicting crude oil prices using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict future prices based on historical data and relevant features.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is 'crude-oil-prices.csv', which contains historical crude oil prices. The dataset includes features such as Date, Closing Price, Open Price, High Price, Low Price, and Volume.

# Steps
## Data Preprocessing:
The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, convert date columns, and scale the data if necessary.

## Feature Engineering: 
Additional features may be created from the existing ones to improve the model's performance.

## Exploratory Data Analysis: 
Analyze the dataset to understand the relationships between features and the target variable.
